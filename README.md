# MCMod (Still in development and name might change)
This api is for spigot plugin creators that want to add custom Block, Items, entities and Guis along with other things.

This api is currently in development and is a bit slow because theres only one working on it, but i will work hard on it and hopefully it will be released for everyone to use for free.

I have opened the [Discussion](https://github.com/PandaDap2006/MCMod/discussions) page if you want to come with ideas for features or ask questions about the api.

You can follow the pruduction of the API on my project page and by following me on my Youtube channel, i will upload clips of features i have added and show how they work from an ingame perspective.
